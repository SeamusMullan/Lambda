#### FAQs
- Can I share the data directly from the app?
	- Currently no, but it is a planned feature for the future. I would like to have either an integration with Email or Messaging services like Discord
- What file types can I open in the content gallery?
	- Currently Lambda saves files in a (format) format, which is what the content gallery uses, hopefully it will be able to support more formats (and therefore more platforms) in the future
- Where are the files saved?
	- The files are saved to your local storage, usually where you installed Lambda. You can change the download folder by following the [[Instructions]].
